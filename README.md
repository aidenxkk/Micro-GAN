## Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd: A minimalist educational project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of automatic differentiation and backpropagation used in training neural networks. 
## MicroGAN: A GAN framework for education purpose 
Based on the basic structure of MLP in Micrograd, this project implements MicroGAN, a simplified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework designed for experimentation and learning. 
### Intro
Generator (G): Generates "fake" data samples from random noise.
Discriminator (D): Distinguishes between "real" and "fake" data.
Adversarial Training: Trains G to produce data that fools D, while training D to correctly classify real and fake data.
