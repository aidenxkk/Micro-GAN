## MicroGAN: A GAN framework for education purpose 
This projbect imiplements MicroGAN, a simplified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework designed for experimentation and learning. 
### Intro
Generator (G): Generates "fake" data samples from random noise.
Discriminator (D): Distinguishes between "real" and "fake" data.
Adversarial Training: Trains G to produce data that fools D, while training D to correctly classify real and fake data.
